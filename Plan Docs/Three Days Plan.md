# **Three Days Plan**

Below is a 3-day plan to develop a traffic prediction tool, incorporating OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) where helpful to accelerate development and enhance functionality. Since you’ve confirmed we’re free to use OpenAI LLMs, I’ve integrated them into key steps like event detection, location parsing, date conversion, and traffic impact scoring to streamline the process and deliver a robust prototype within the tight timeline.

## **Day 1: News Ingestion and Event Detection**

### **Morning: Project Setup and News Ingestion**

* **Setup:**  
  * Create a GitHub repository for version control.  
  * Set up a Python virtual environment and install essential libraries: openai, requests, geopy, streamlit, and folium.  
* **News Source:**  
  * Use NewsAPI (free tier) to fetch real articles or create mock articles with future events (e.g., "Concert next Saturday in San Francisco") for simplicity during testing.  
* **Event Detection with OpenAI LLM:**  
  * Leverage OpenAI’s GPT-4 API to process article text and extract traffic-related events. Use a prompt like:  
     text  
    CollapseWrapCopy  
    `"Extract traffic-related events from this article, including the event type (e.g., concert, road closure), location, and date."`

  * The LLM will return structured data (e.g., {event\_type: "concert", location: "San Francisco", date: "next Saturday"}), eliminating the need for custom NLP code.

### **Afternoon: Data Processing and Storage**

* **Location Extraction:**  
  * Use the LLM-extracted locations and convert them to coordinates with geopy (e.g., OpenStreetMap geocoding). For example, "San Francisco" becomes (37.7749, \-122.4194).  
* **Date Parsing with OpenAI LLM:**  
  * For relative dates like "next Saturday," use the LLM again with a prompt:  
     text  
    CollapseWrapCopy  
    `"Convert 'next Saturday' to a specific date based on today's date."`

  * This ensures accurate date conversion without complex manual parsing logic.  
* **Data Storage:**  
  * Store event details (title, location, coordinates, date) in a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and retrieval.

**Milestone:** By the end of Day 1, you’ll have a script that uses OpenAI’s LLM to extract structured event data from articles, converts locations to coordinates, resolves dates, and stores everything in a DataFrame.

## **Day 2: Geo-tagging and Traffic Prediction**

### **Morning: Traffic Impact and Grid System**

* **Traffic Impact with OpenAI LLM:**  
  * Use the LLM to assign traffic impact scores to events. Prompt it with:  
     text  
    CollapseWrapCopy  
    `"Based on the event type 'concert', estimate its traffic impact on a scale of 1 to 5."`

  * For example, a concert might score 4, while a minor road closure scores 2\. This dynamic scoring replaces manual rule-based systems.  
* **Grid System:**  
  * Focus on one city (e.g., San Francisco) and divide its map into a grid (e.g., 1 km x 1 km squares). Assign events to grid cells based on their coordinates.

### **Afternoon: Prediction and Visualization**

* **Traffic Prediction:**  
  * For a given date, calculate a traffic score for each grid by summing the LLM-assigned impact scores of events in that grid.  
* **Visualization:**  
  * Build a basic Streamlit app with a folium map. Display the grid system, coloring each grid based on its traffic score (e.g., green for low, yellow for medium, red for high).

**Milestone:** By the end of Day 2, you’ll have a traffic prediction system powered by LLM-generated impact scores and a Streamlit app showing a color-coded map of traffic impacts.

## **Day 3: User Interface and Final Touches**

### **Morning: Interactive Features**

* **Date Selection:**  
  * Add a Streamlit date picker widget so users can select a prediction date.  
* **Dynamic Map Updates:**  
  * Filter events by the selected date and update the map’s traffic predictions accordingly.  
* **Event Markers:**  
  * Plot markers on the map for events on the chosen date, with popups showing details (e.g., event title, impact score).

### **Afternoon: Polishing and Testing**

* **UI Enhancements:**  
  * Add a legend to explain the color coding and tooltips for grids/markers with extra info (e.g., total traffic score or event count).  
* **Testing:**  
  * Test the full workflow with mock data, ensuring news ingestion, LLM-powered event detection, prediction, and visualization function smoothly.  
* **Documentation:**  
  * Write a README with brief instructions on setup (e.g., installing libraries, setting up an OpenAI API key) and running the tool.

**Milestone:** By the end of Day 3, you’ll have a fully functional prototype: a Streamlit app with an interactive map showing traffic predictions and event details for user-selected dates, enhanced by OpenAI’s LLM capabilities.

## **Key Notes**

* **Scope:** Limit the tool to one city (e.g., San Francisco) and predict daily traffic impacts (not hourly) to keep it manageable.  
* **Simplification:** Use mock articles with planned events (e.g., concerts) rather than unpredictable ones (e.g., accidents) for the minimum viable product (MVP).  
* **OpenAI LLM Usage:** The LLM handles event detection, date parsing, and impact scoring, making the development faster and more flexible.

## **Deliverables**

1. A Python script using OpenAI’s LLM to extract events (locations, dates, impact scores) from articles.  
2. A traffic prediction function calculating grid scores based on LLM-assigned impacts.  
3. A Streamlit app with an interactive map showing traffic predictions and event markers.  
4. Basic setup and usage instructions in a README.

This plan leverages OpenAI’s LLM to simplify complex tasks, ensuring you deliver a working traffic prediction tool within 3 days while maintaining focus on essential features.
